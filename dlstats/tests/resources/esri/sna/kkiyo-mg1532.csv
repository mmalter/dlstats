＊国内総生産(支出側)に対する寄与度,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
＊寄与度は次式により算出した。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
　　寄与度＝（当期の実数−前年同期の実数）÷前年同期の国内総生産(支出側)×１００,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
＊四捨五入の関係上、各項目の寄与度の合計は必ずしも国内総生産(支出側)の増加率には一致しない。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
＊財貨・サービスの輸入は国内総生産(支出側)の控除項目となるので、寄与度は逆符号で表示した。例えば、財貨・サービスの輸入が増加すると、寄与度はマイナスの符号となる。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
