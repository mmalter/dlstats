＊国内総生産(支出側)に対する寄与度、ただし海外からの所得は国民総所得に対する寄与度,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
＊寄与度は次式により算出した。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
　　寄与度＝（当期の実数−前期の実数）÷前期の国内総生産(支出側)（または国民総所得）×１００,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
＊四捨五入の関係上、各項目の寄与度の合計は必ずしも国内総生産(支出側)、もしくは国民総所得の増加率には一致しない。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
＊財貨・サービスの輸入は国内総生産(支出側)、海外からの所得支払は国民総所得の控除項目となるので、寄与度は逆符号で表示した。例えば、財貨・サービスの輸入が増加すると、寄与度はマイナスの符号となる。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
