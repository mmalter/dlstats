＊四捨五入の関係上、各項目の寄与度の合計は必ずしも国内総生産(支出側)、もしくは国民総所得の増加率には一致しない。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
＊財貨・サービスの輸入は国内総生産(支出側)、海外からの所得支払は国民総所得の控除項目となるので、寄与度は逆符号で表示した。例えば、財貨・サービスの輸入が増加すると、寄与度はマイナスの符号となる。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
＊財貨・サービスの純輸出の寄与度は財貨・サービスの輸出の寄与度−財貨・サービスの輸入の寄与度により求めている。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
